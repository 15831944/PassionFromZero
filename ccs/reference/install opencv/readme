0.  sudo apt-get install cmake


1.  Create a temporary directory, which we denote as <cmake_binary_dir>, where you want to put the generated Makefiles, project files as well the object files and output binaries.


2.  Enter the <cmake_binary_dir> and type:

cmake [<some optional parameters>] <path to the OpenCV source directory>

For example:

cd ~/opencv
mkdir release
cd release
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..


3.  Enter the created temporary directory (<cmake_binary_dir>) and proceed with:

make
sudo make install
